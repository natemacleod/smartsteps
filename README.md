This application for Android Wear aims to replicate a function on my old smartwatch that is not present on my current one.

Each day, it creates a new step goal based on the user's recent movement habits.

It uses Android Wear Compose for UI and Room for data storage.

This project was created in 2021. A small update has been made in 2022 to clean up the code.
